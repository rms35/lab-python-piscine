# Lab: Python Piscine

Python programming fundamentals and piscine exercises.

[![Language: Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-Python-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

## 🛠 Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

Exercises are organized by modules (e.g., `py00`).

```bash
python3 py00/ex01/test.py
```

## 🏗 Architecture

### Modular Structure
Each directory represents a specific day or topic in the Python curriculum, covering data types, control flow, and functional programming.

## ⚖️ Trade-offs

- **Scripting vs. OOP:** Early modules focus on procedural scripting to master syntax, while later exercises transition to Object-Oriented principles.
- **Standard Library focus:** Prioritizes Python's built-in functions over third-party libraries to ensure a deep understanding of core language features.
